### What we are looking for
Overall we want to make sure that the app is in a stable and working condition with its current features. We are also hoping that the app is intuitive enough to use without instructions and that the workflow is pleasant so that dozens of items could be created without much hassle or discomfort.

*Please note that the current design is completely temporary and it is part of the next phase in development. The app currently uses Google's standard material design template.*

Please help us identify:
- Bugs
- Crashes and freezes
- Noticeable performance issues
- Missing or corrupted content
- Confusing workflow 
	- Can't find something? 
	- Keep navigating to unintended pages?
	- Too much navigation, back and forth?
- Frustrations
- Improvements to make things easier/more efficient
- (Name suggestions! Our one good idea was taken)

### What we aren't looking for (at the moment)
For this phase of testing we'd like to focus on what exists to ensure a stable and cohesive experience before moving on to explore new features and expand the utility of the app. The intention is to keep adding new and exciting features post launch!

### Known issues
- Collection and item screens can become slow/sluggish (please still report these and whether anything particular is triggering it)
- Temporary stock images change/re-download when app restarts
- Image loading indicator don't display until the very end of loading an image
- Long names aren't displayed correctly (this will be addressed with re-design)
- Deleting a collection or item displays a temporary empty/unavailable page

### Reporting issues
- Send an email to [[bugs@cosmic.monster]] with detailed instructions of how to reproduce the issues you're reporting. Please include Mobile OS version and phone model if performance/crash/freeze related.

Here are some things that can help identify the issue:

Screens :

- Item Screen (displays details of a particular item)

Other parts of the app:
- App bar (top bar containing title, back button and screen specific buttons)
